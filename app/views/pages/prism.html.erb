      <h4>Description:</h4>
      <p>In this study, we are testing the ability of a new suicide prevention screening instrument to predict future suicide attempts among military personnel, retirees, and family members seeking care from military primary care clinics. We are additionally seeking to quantify the proportion of individuals who are "missed" by existing screening methods. This study is currently underway.</p>
