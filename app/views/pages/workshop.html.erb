        <h2><span>BRIEF COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY FOR SUICIDAL SERVICE MEMBERS AND VETERANS WORKSHOP SUMMARY</span></h2>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>This two-day workshop is geared towards mental health professionals seeking to acquire entry-level information and training on the assessment, management, and treatment of suicide risk among suicidal military personnel and veterans. The first portion of the workshop provides intensive training in core competencies for the clinical care of suicidal patients, including general interpersonal dynamics, standardization of suicide-related terminology, and documentation strategies. The workshop then provides a detailed, step-by-step review of the 12-session brief cognitive behavioral therapy (BCBT) treatment protocol. Practical strategies for effective treatment delivery are provided using case examples, role plays, and skills practice, which illustrate concepts and interventions. Participants will receive a copy of the BCBT manual for future use with patients.</p>

The first half of the workshop provides didactic knowledge about suicide, the development of the crisis response plan intervention, and its empirical support, all of which are designed to increase clinician knowledge. The second half of the workshop includes clinical demonstrations by the instructor and skills practice by attendees, which are designed for clinicians to acquire skill competency.</p>

        <h4><span>CRISIS RESPONSE PLANNING FOR SUICIDE PREVENTION</span></h4>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>The Crisis Response Plan (CRP) is a brief procedure used to reduce an individual's risk for suicidal behavior. The CRP is created collaboratively between a suicidal individual and a trained  helper, and is typically handwritten on an index card for easy, convenient access during times of  need. The CRP serves as a checklist to follow during periods of intense emotional distress. At its core, the CRP helps someone remember what to do when they feel emotionally  overwhelmed.</p>
