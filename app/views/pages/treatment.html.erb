    <h4>BRIEF COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY FOR SUICIDAL SERVICE MEMBERS AND VETERANS WORKSHOP SUMMARY</h4>
    <br>
    <p>This two-day workshop is geared towards mental health professionals seeking to acquire entry-level information and training on the assessment, management, and treatment of suicide risk among suicidal military personnel and veterans. The first portion of the workshop provides intensive training in core competencies for the clinical care of suicidal patients, including general interpersonal dynamics, standardization of suicide-related terminology, and documentation strategies. The workshop then provides a detailed, step-by-step review of the 12-session brief cognitive behavioral therapy (BCBT) treatment protocol. Practical strategies for effective treatment delivery are provided using case examples, role plays, and skills practice, which illustrate concepts and interventions. Participants will receive a copy of the BCBT manual for future use with patients.</p>
